\resumenen{This thesis project analyses the performance of the USRP (Universal Software Radio
Peripheral) as a tool for the study of digital modulation techniques and the software defined radio
concept. The characterization of the system was done using the open source GNURadio software. A
one-way modem was implemented using QPSK modulation (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) to transmit
generated data from a file and its performance was evaluated by analyzing its spectrum and signal
constellation as well as its power spectral distribution. The file transmission was done at
different bitrates to determine the maximum reliable transfer rate between the host PC and the USRP
as well as analyzing its bit error rate over a wired coaxial medium.}
